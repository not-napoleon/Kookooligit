DONE!
[X] Stop passing the main SDL_Surface around
[X] Split map.get_visible_reigon into window centering and FOV calc
  [X] Don't compute FoV in look mode window border check

[X] Make reference to MAP_SECTION_SIZE in draw_map.c a parameter
[X] Even better, put the size in the map struct
[X] Render the look cursor as a background color change, like a real cursor
[X] Beef up the logging "framework" to actually include some log levels

[X] bigger indents!
    [X] Local indent config and/or get clang-formatter working right
