[X] Stop passing the main SDL_Surface around
[ ] Split map.get_visible_reigon into window centering and FOV calc
  [ ] Don't compute FoV in look mode window border check
[ ] Look mode should not give info on unexplored tiles
[ ] Switch to shaded rendering
  [ ] Render the look cursor as a background color change, like a real cursor
[ ] Beef up the logging "framework" to actually include some log levels
[ ] Add a SCREAM_AND_DIE macro to log.h to dump a stack trace and exit
    - see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/105659/how-can-one-grab-a-stack-trace-in-c
[ ] Move logging control flags to makefile
[ ] Make reference to MAP_SECTION_SIZE in draw_map.c a parameter
[ ] Make MAP_SECTION_SIZE internal to map.c
[ ] Even better, put the size in the map struct
[ ] Move look & movement code out of game.c (map.c maybe)
