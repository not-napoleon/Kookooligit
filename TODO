Look Mode
[ ] Look mode should not give info on unexplored tiles
[X] Render the look cursor as a background color change, like a real cursor

Logging
[X] Beef up the logging "framework" to actually include some log levels
[ ] Add a SCREAM_AND_DIE macro to log.h to dump a stack trace and exit
    - see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/105659/how-can-one-grab-a-stack-trace-in-c
[ ] Move logging control flags to makefile

Map cleanup
[ ] Stop passing map size to dark_map
[ ] Move look & movement code out of game.c (map.c maybe) (started)
[ ] Clean up lost creatures from recycled map sections

General cleanup
[ ] Stop using typedefs for structs, enums

DONE!
[X] Stop passing the main SDL_Surface around
[X] Split map.get_visible_reigon into window centering and FOV calc
  [X] Don't compute FoV in look mode window border check

[X] Make reference to MAP_SECTION_SIZE in draw_map.c a parameter
[X] Even better, put the size in the map struct
